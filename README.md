## About AWS Availability Zones
Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated data centers within an AWS region. They provide redundancy and high availability for your applications.

### **Best Practices:**
- Distribute resources across multiple AZs to ensure high availability.
- Use Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancing across AZs.
- Store backups in a different AZ or region for disaster recovery.
